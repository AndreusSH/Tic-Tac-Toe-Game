# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This was part of the advanced front end FreecodeCamp curriculum. 
I am planning to improve the "AI" as soon as I have time!

You can choose which player you want to use ("X" or "O")
Once the game is finished, you can reset

These are the instructions that I followed doing this project
